Space Frontier Game

# Idea
The game is a mix of classic RPG games and a city builder mechanics.
The players role is to manage a small settlement and optimise, expand and maintain it, so that it can thrive and eventually allow to yield some rewards.

# Tech
## Client
Client is built using Unity as a webGL build.
- this allows hassle-free connection to most wallets
- since the build size is relatively small, it allows to start playing within seconds after clicking the link (no istalls etc).

## Anchor
On chain program fully controls the game state, by handling player actions and storing the player state.
